# 🧠 Two-Player Math Game (Ruby)

This is a simple command-line math game built with Ruby to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. 
It supports two players who take turns answering randomly generated addition questions. 
Players start with 3 lives and lose a life each time they answer incorrectly. 
The game ends when one player loses all their lives.

This project is part of my learnings at the Web Development Flex Program at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en).
